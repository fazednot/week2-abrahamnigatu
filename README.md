In this project, I have performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a telecommunications dataset to identify key insights and trends. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature extraction, correlation analysis, and visualization using tools like pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The cleaned data was saved into both CSV and SQLite database formats for further analysis and accessibility. A Streamlit app was also developed to visualize the data interactively, featuring scatter plots, correlation matrices, histograms, and time series analysis. This project demonstrates my ability to handle real-world data, apply data science techniques, and present insights through interactive visualizations.
